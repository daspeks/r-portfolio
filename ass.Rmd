This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#5 In the dataset “cabbages”, select the data for which the cultivar (Cult) is “c39”.
newdata <- cabbages[ which(cabbages$Cult=='c39'), ]
newdata
```

```{r}
#6 In the dataset “cabbages”, calculate the average cabbage head weight (HeadWt) of cabbages for which cultivar is “c39”.
c39mean <- aggregate(.~Cult, data=newdata, mean)[3]

mean( cabbages$HeadWt[ cabbages$Cult=='c39' ] )

# a) Graph a scatter plot of cabbage head weights and their vitamin C (VitC) content.
# b) Properly name the x and y axes.
HeadWt = cabbages$HeadWt
VitC = cabbages$VitC 
plot(HeadWt, VitC, col='green', main='Scatter plot of cabbage head weights and their vitamin C content', xlab="Head Weight", ylab="Vitamin C")

# c) Add a linear estimate of the relationship to the graph.
abline(lm(VitC ~ HeadWt))

# d) Find the correlation between these two variables - Vitamin C content decreases with increasing Head weight
cor(VitC,HeadWt)
```

```{r}
# 8 Compute the frequency of values for Cult type

cabbages %>%
  count(Cult)
```
```{r}
# 8 Compute the frequency of values for Date type
cabbages %>%
  count(Date)
```


```{r}
# 9

# a) Create 1 bar plot of the “Cult” variable, 1 pie plot of the “Date” variable and put both plots in one figure
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
tbl <- with(cabbages, table(Cult))
barplot(tbl, main='Bar Plot of Cult Variable', beside=TRUE, border='blue', col='green')
tbl <- with(cabbages, table(Date))
pie(tbl, main='Pie Plot of Date Variable', border='blue', col=c('green', 'lightblue', 'grey'))
```

```{r}
# b) create a histogram of the variable “VitC” (one single graph filled by the figure).
hist(cabbages$VitC, main='Histogram for Vitamin C', xlab='Vitamin C', border='blue', col="green")
```
```{r}
# 10
# a) Import the attached “ad.csv” file to R as an object called “data”, once using read.csv and once using fread. Add libraries if needed.
library(data.table)
data <- fread('./ad.csv')
head(data)
data <- read.csv(file = './ad.csv')
head(data)

# b) Create a simple linear regression model for sales using TV advertising variable. Does TV advertising impact sales? Predict the sales for when TV advertising is 75.
sales = data$sales
tv    = data$TV 
radio = data$radio 
news  = data$newspaper

plot(tv, sales, col='green', main='Effect of TV ads on Sales', xlab="TV ads", ylab="Sales")
abline(lm(sales ~ tv))
fit <- lm(sales ~ tv, data=data)
predict(fit, data.frame(tv = 75))

# c) Create a multiple linear regression model for sales using TV, radio, and newspaper advertising variables.
sales.lm <- lm(sales ~ tv + radio + news, data=data)

# d) Draw the normality plot of residuals for the multiple linear regression. What does it say?
sales.stdres = rstandard(sales.lm)
qqnorm(sales.stdres, ylab='Standardized Residuals', xlab='Normal Scores') 
qqline(sales.stdres)
```
```{r}
# 11 From dataset “cabbages”,
# a) Create a multiple linear regression model (with categorical variables) that uses Cult, Date, and HeadWt to predict VitC.
test <- cabbages
test$Date <- as.numeric(test$Date)
test$Cult <- as.numeric(test$Cult)
test.lm <- lm(VitC ~ Cult + Date + HeadWt, data = test)

# b) Predict vitamin C of a cabbage with HeadWt of 2, Date of d16, and Cult of c52.
pdata = data.frame(HeadWt=2, Date=1, Cult=2)
predict(test.lm, pdata)
